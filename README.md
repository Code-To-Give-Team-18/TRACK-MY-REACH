## üéØ Problem Statement

Donor engagement is essential for nonprofits like Project REACH because it transforms passive support into active partnership. When donors feel emotionally connected and clearly see the impact of their contributions, they're more likely to give consistently, advocate for the cause, and become long-term allies.

### The Issues We're Solving

**Issue 1: Donor Retention**  
REACH has difficulty retaining their current donors, and they feel that their engagement with donors is insufficient.

**Issue 2: Impact Visibility**  
Donors are unable to see their impact, and they lack sufficient emotional attachment that is important for their continued support to their beneficiaries.

**Issue 3: Growth & Awareness**  
REACH struggles to attract new donors and effectively spread awareness about their organisation. This limits their ability to grow their donor base and sustain long-term support.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Track My REACH is an all-in-one platform designed to strengthen the connection between donors and underprivileged K3 students in Hong Kong through:

### üöÄ Core Features

2. **Seamless Social Integration** ‚Äì Provide a platform for people to keep up with their beneficiaries and amplify the children's reach with engaging, short-form features inspired by YouTube Shorts and TikTok

3. **Impactful Giving** ‚Äì Donate in seconds and witness your contributions through real-time impact visualizations

4. **Spread the Joy** ‚Äì Earn rewards with our referral system and climb the tier as a top contributor

Admins can easily broadcast posts across all social media platforms, boosting engagement and outreach while saving valuable time.

### 2. Easy Donations
Frictionless, one-click donations let donors give instantly without extra steps that might delay or discourage them.

### 3. Donation Visualization

Donation visualization helps donors see the direct impact on each child, encouraging larger contributions by showing how their gift translates into real benefits for a child.

### 4. Referral System

Our referral system lets donors multiply their impact by inviting family and friends. More referrals move them up tiers, unlocking added recognition and rewards.

### 5. Keep Up With The Kids
Scroll seamlessly through videos that keep donors updated on each child's journey. With personalised recommendations, donors will always see the latest milestones and discover new stories to support.
